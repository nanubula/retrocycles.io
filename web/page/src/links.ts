// The page's own links beside the invite (?join=, platform/quickplay.ts) and the emailed
// account links (?account=, App.tsx):
//
// - ?play (the /play/ link, public/play/index.html): Quick Play as soon as the page is ready,
//   as an invite link does for its room. Read once and taken out of the address bar.
// - ?embed (the share card's player, index.html's twitter:player): the page inside a social
//   post's frame. The deploy lets those sites frame this URL alone (frame-ancestors, not
//   cross-origin isolated: their pages are not). The page there is one PLAY over the scene
//   (components/Embed.tsx) and plays without a platform session: the session cookie would be
//   a third-party one, which browsers drop (platform/session.ts). Kept in the address bar, so a
//   reload in the frame stays the embed.

// - Inside a Discord Activity: Discord opens the page with ?frame_id=...&instance_id=...
//   (src/discord.ts). It is an embed too (one PLAY, compact, silent at first), but
//   with a platform session: Discord signs the player in. Its frame forbids WebRTC, so the
//   game packets go over the signalling WebSocket; ?transport=websocket picks that
//   transport anywhere, for tests.
